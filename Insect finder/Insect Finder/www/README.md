# Debug, a Pest-Classifierüêû

## Inspiration
Farmers rely heavily on crop yields as their main source of income. However, many pests can get in the way of optimal production yields as they can eat and harm the field crops. Pesticides are commonly used by many farmers to get rid of them. Despite that, the large quantities of pesticides used to spray on acres of farmland can be expensive, and many times, farmers misuse pesticides on the wrong bugs. The overuse of pesticides has many consequences which can cost farmers money, time, and resources:

- First, the EPA estimates up to **70 million pounds of pesticides are lost to drift each year**, a common issue in which extra pesticide chemicals are carried by the wind, hurting the ecosystems, the farmer's wallet, and human health.
- Second, an overabundance of pesticides on the wrong species can lead to **pesticide resistance**. As a result, pesticide costs should be expected to increase as new variations of the pesticide are more expensive. 
- Third, **spraying pesticides on beneficial pests** can negatively impact the production rate of the farmer's crops, which is a waste of money. 

These effects worsen each year, causing rural/small farmers to lose thousands of dollars, as on average, they spend around $21,000 on pesticides alone as of 2019. This number will only increase in the coming years. 
 
## What it does
This is where the Debug application comes into play. Using Debug, farmers are able to upload a picture of a recurrent bug they observe in their fields. Once uploaded, they are provided with a brief summary of the pest and whether it is harmful or not, along with some potential pesticides or alternatives they could use. This way, the farmers will be able to save money invested in trying to ward away bugs that appear to be pests but are not.  

## How we built it
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript/JQuery
- [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
- [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/index)
- [Tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)

## Challenges we ran into
The most challenging component of this project was definitely the machine learning aspect. There were many image Javascript libraries out there that we could use, so it took time to find the best fit for this application, which turned out to be TensorFlow. 
Additoinally, adding the Drag and Drop feature to the website was a great challenge. There were many tutorials, but many of them contained bugs that rendered their suggestions useless. In fact, while implementing this code, the web application stopped working, requiring us to back track. Fortunately, with perseverance on our side, we eventually figured out how to implement the feature seamlessly into Debug.
Overall, many of our issues were quickly solved as each of us had varied skills and open minds. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are  proud to have implemented an image classification model to real world applications such as the ongoing food crisis and the overuse of pesticides in a short amount of time. All of us applied our strengths and learned lots of new skills along the way!

## What we learned
This was the first time many of us have attempted machine learning, so we learned a lot about model training, how to incorporate datasets, and integrate it into a user-friendly platform. 

## What's next for Debug
We are planning to expand our database of bugs and improve the machine learning model to improve the accuracy of the web application. We are also planning on making a mobile application for iOS and Android so the service is more convenient to use. 

## Contributors
Debug was created between June 5th and 7th, 2020 during the "Hack the Northeast" hackathon.
